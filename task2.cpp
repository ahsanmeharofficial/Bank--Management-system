Here's the revised, more concise, and humanized version of the C++ code, using namespace std:

cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Course {
public:
    string name;
    int courseNumber;
    int credits;

    Course(const string& name, int courseNumber, int credits)
        : name(name), courseNumber(courseNumber), credits(credits) {}
};

class FacultyMember {
public:
    string name;
    string rank;
    string officeLocation;
    vector<Course*> courses;

    FacultyMember(const string& name, const string& rank, const string& officeLocation)
        : name(name), rank(rank), officeLocation(officeLocation) {}

    void teachCourse(Course* course) {
        courses.push_back(course);
    }
};

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int studentID;
    float GPA;
    vector<Course*> courses;

    Student(const string& name, int studentID, float GPA)
        : name(name), studentID(studentID), GPA(GPA) {}

    void enrollInCourse(Course* course) {
        courses.push_back(course);
    }
};

class Department {
public:
    string name;
    string chairperson;
    vector<FacultyMember*> facultyMembers;
    vector<Student*> students;
    vector<Course*> courses;

    Department(const string& name, const string& chairperson)
        : name(name), chairperson(chairperson) {}

    void addFacultyMember(FacultyMember* facultyMember) {
        facultyMembers.push_back(facultyMember);
    }

    void addStudent(Student* student) {
        students.push_back(student);
    }

    void addCourse(Course* course) {
        courses.push_back(course);
    }
};

class University {
public:
    vector<Department*> departments;

    void addDepartment(Department* department) {
        departments.push_back(department);
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "University Departments: " << endl;
        for (auto dept : departments) {
            cout << "Department: " << dept->name << ", Chairperson: " << dept->chairperson << endl;

            cout << "Courses offered: " << endl;
            for (auto course : dept->courses) {
                cout << "Course: " << course->name << ", Number: " << course->courseNumber << ", Credits: " << course->credits << endl;
            }

            cout << "Faculty Members: " << endl;
            for (auto faculty : dept->facultyMembers) {
                cout << "Name: " << faculty->name << ", Rank: " << faculty->rank << ", Office: " << faculty->officeLocation << endl;
                cout << "Courses taught: " << endl;
                for (auto course : faculty->courses) {
                    cout << "Course: " << course->name << endl;
                }
            }

            cout << "Students: " << endl;
            for (auto student : dept->students) {
                cout << "Name: " << student->name << ", ID: " << student->studentID << ", GPA: " << student->GPA << endl;
                cout << "Courses enrolled: " << endl;
                for (auto course : student->courses) {
                    cout << "Course: " << course->name << endl;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    University university;

    Department* csDept = new Department("Computer Science", "Dr. Smith");
    university.addDepartment(csDept);

    Course* course1 = new Course("Data Structures", 101, 3);
    Course* course2 = new Course("Algorithms", 102, 3);

    csDept->addCourse(course1);
    csDept->addCourse(course2);

    FacultyMember* profJones = new FacultyMember("Prof. Jones", "Associate Professor", "Room 101");
    csDept->addFacultyMember(profJones);
    profJones->teachCourse(course1);
    profJones->teachCourse(course2);

    Student* student1 = new Student("Alice", 1001, 3.8);
    Student* student2 = new Student("Bob", 1002, 3.5);

    csDept->addStudent(student1);
    csDept->addStudent(student2);

    student1->enrollInCourse(course1);
    student2->enrollInCourse(course2);

    university.display();

    // Cleanup dynamically allocated memory
    delete csDept;
    delete course1;
    delete course2;
    delete profJones;
    delete student1;
    delete student2;

    return 0;
}


This code retains the functionality of the original but is streamlined for readability and simplicity. The University::display method consolidates output operations, making the main function cleaner and more concise.
